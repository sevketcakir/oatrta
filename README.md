You can download the app [at](https://github.com/sevketcakir/oatrta/releases/download/alpha/pedalstest.exe)

Right now, virustotal thinks the application is a trojan, see the report [at here(7c80431ad6014a8c38cb40c097285e6d99a708e5d422b60f217eeb90c28e3e99)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7c80431ad6014a8c38cb40c097285e6d99a708e5d422b60f217eeb90c28e3e99/detection). This seems like a false positive([see](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg)), but use it with your own risk. I'm trying to change the binaries that creates the exe file.

If you like my work and want me to continue:
